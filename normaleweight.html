    <p>6 Habits People with Healthy Weights Have in Common:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h2 class="lititle1"> 1.breakfast</h2>
        <img class="img1" src="./img/1.jpg" alt="breakfast">
            <p>We’ve all heard this one a thousand times, but the healthiest among us have taken it to heart. According to the study, a whopping 96 percent of those who maintain a healthy weight eat breakfast every day. Also worth noting: Fruits, veggies, and eggs were mainstays in their first meal of the day. So bust out those kale smoothie and egg white omelet recipes.
            </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2 class="lititle1"> 2.workout</h2>

        <p> 
            Not to be all Captain Obvious here, but exercise was a routine fixture for the healthy adults surveyed. Forty-two percent reported exercising at least five times a week. If you can't dedicate that much time to your sweat sessions, you can make the most of your workouts by tweaking them to burn more calories.
        </p>
    </li>
    
      <li>
        <h2 class="lititle1">3.scale in</h2>
        <img class="img1" src="./img/3.jpg" alt="scalein">
        <p> We've got a little bit of a love/hate relationship with the scale (it's not a totally accurate way to measure your progress), but according to the survey, it’s a fixture in the lives of those who stay slim. Half reported weighing themselves at least once a week.
            Not a fan of those little blinking numbers? Try using this strategy to track your progress instead of weekly weigh-ins.

        <h2 class="lititle1"> 4.diet</h2>

        <p> The healthiest participants weren’t fans of dieting and almost 75 percent said they never followed a specific diet trend. But that doesn’t mean they'll eat everything and anything: Ninety-two percent said they paid close attention to the foods they ate.</p>
